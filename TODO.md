# To-Do
- [x] Connect to supercomputer
  1. Connect to Exeter VPN if not on campus
  2. `ssh ie230@carpathia.astro.ex.ac.uk`
  3. Enter password
- [x] Add in y-component of the momentum equation
- [x] Setup git repository  
- [] run a simulation with Coriolis term included to verify correct orientation of axis
- [x] Save copies of run_param files with corresponding simulations to easily access various parameters of the problem
- [x] Rename folders containing resulting figures to easily identify which parameters were used
- [] print figures from simulations of interest to refer to in lab book
- [x] Upload rotational results to the shared github repository
- [] Compare orientation of personal rotational code to Simon's to spot any inconsistencies
